python

*high level language
*dynamic semantics
*interpreted
*object oriented


Advantages

-concise and expressive syntax
-extensive standard library
-cross platform 
-strong community
-versatility of various applications
-opensource
-ML/AI

variables - stores data
data types are string, float , Boolean
string="hello"
float=12
Boolean=true/false

eg:
age=12
age=this is the variable
12=value store in the variable

rules for variables

* variable name start only with letter or underscore
*cannot start with number
*cannot be keyword
*case sensitive
*only contain alphanumeric

keywords= reserved words are keywords
eg:

False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield


good variables name are

-choose meaning name
-maintain the length
-use lowercase letters with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability

f string

To write the variables in sentence use "f" and variables in {}
In Python, the f in print(f"...") signifies a formatted string literal, also known as an f-string. F-strings provide a concise and efficient way to embed expressions directly within string literals.
Here's how f-strings are used and their benefits:
Embedding Expressions: You can embed Python expressions, including variables, function calls, and arithmetic operations, directly within an f-string by enclosing them in curly braces {}. The f-string then evaluates these expressions at runtime and replaces them with their resulting values.


INPUT FUNCTION

input function is used to prompt the user or enter value from keyboard
eg:
 variables=input("")

name=input("enter your name : ")
snack=input("enter your favourite snack : ")
print(f"Welcome {name} your favourite snack is {snack} is ready")
 output :enter your name : Jinu
enter your favourite snack : chips
Welcome Jinu your favourite snack is chips is ready


"""income=int(input("Enter your income "))
expense=int(input("Enter your expense "))
balance = income - expense
print(f"your savings is {balance} ")""" is called dot string 
if we use # this totally commanding
 

Arithmetic operations
*,+,-,/,//,**

comparison operations
> ,<,>=,<=,==!=

Logical operators
and , or , not

python data types
numeric- integers , complex number,Float
dictionary(key -value)
Boolean(true,flase)
Set(immutables - doesn't change)
Sequence Type(sequnce of characters) = Strings, list , Tuple

how to find the type of data ?
a="23"
b=23
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
o/p= string
float
